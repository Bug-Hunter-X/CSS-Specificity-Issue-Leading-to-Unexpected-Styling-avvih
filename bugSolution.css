The solution involves restructuring the CSS to improve readability and manage specificity:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special-class {
  color: red;
}

#special-id {
  color: green;
}

/*More specific selectors are applied only when needed*/
.special-class #special-id {
  color: purple;
}

/*Avoid nested selectors and use more descriptive class names*/
.special-class-in-id {
  color: orange;
}

```

By avoiding deeply nested selectors and being mindful of specificity order, we can prevent unexpected behavior. Using more descriptive class names also improves readability and maintainability.
